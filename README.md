# pepvaluator-math
A evaluator for mathematical expressions written in python!

## Unfinished
This project currently does not work but it is nearing completion. I have no clue how to do this, I'm not having any external help and so someone more experienced may look at this and see 10 more efficient and effective ways but this is just something I wanted to write for fun so I decided to not worry about the absolute best practices in computational maths evaluation :)

## Supported operators

The initally supported operators will be:
              
              + - / * % ^

There will be more added in the future!
These are on the list:

|-10| = 10
sqrt 100 = 10
cbrt 1000 = 10
sin/cos/tan and the respective inverses (maybe more trigonometric functions)
